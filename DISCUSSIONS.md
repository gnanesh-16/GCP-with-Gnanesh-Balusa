## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: I'm completely new to cloud. Where should I start?**
**A:** Start with [Day 1: Mastering How Cloud Works](basics/day-1-mastering-how-cloud-works.md). It covers all the fundamental concepts you need to understand before diving into GCP-specific topics.

### **Q: How can I practice without spending money?**
**A:** Check out Day 2's section on avoiding surprising costs! Use the Google Cloud Free Tier, set up billing alerts, and focus on the `e2-micro` instances mentioned in Day 3.

### **Q: I'm getting lost in GCP's console. Any tips?**
**A:** This is common! Review the GCP Hierarchy section in Day 2. Understanding Projects, Folders, and Organization will make navigation much clearer.

### **Q: How long should I spend on each day's content?**
**A:** Take your time! Some people finish a day's content in 2-3 hours, others need a week. The important thing is understanding, not speed.

### **Q: Should I memorize all the service names and features?**
**A:** Focus on understanding concepts first, then gradually learn service names. The hands-on practice will help you remember naturally.

### **Q: Is this enough for GCP certification?**
**A:** This is a great foundation! For certification, you'll need additional practice exams, hands-on labs, and probably more advanced topics. Use the discussions to connect with others on the certification journey.
